Usage:
  Compile and Upload
    In this folder create a folder lib
    Add libSparkFun to this folder
    Add libMakeModel, or equivalent, to this folder
    Compile program
    Upload to Arduino
  Run Program:
    Connect to OBD-II Connector to car
    Open Terminal. You should see teh following:

    Turn off car
  Analyze Data:  
    Down load LOG.TXT from the BRAKE folder on sd card
    Load file into LibreOffice Calc
    Create pivot table as follows:
      ROW_FIELD     AID
      COLUM_FIELDS  state
      FIELDS        Mean-D0,Mean-D1,Mean-D2,Mean-D3,Mean-D4,Mean-D5,Mean-D6,Mean-D7
    
      Idenify the AIDs that have the biggest diferences for one or my Bytes between the two states.    
  An example analysis is shown in the extras folder
